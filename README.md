# To-Do List App

A simple, dark-themed To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with data stored in the browser's local storage to keep tasks saved even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by entering text and clicking "Add Task."
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them, which toggles a "completed" style.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain available after page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling with a dark mode theme.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for adding, marking, and deleting tasks, and managing local storage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How It Works

- **Adding a Task**: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task." The task is added to the list and saved in local storage.
- **Completing a Task**: Click on a task to toggle its completed state.
- **Deleting a Task**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list and local storage.

## Future Enhancements

- Add due dates or reminders.
- Filter tasks by completed or pending status.
- Improve styling and add animations.
